NO DEALING DESK: FXCMS EXECUTION

FXCM innovated transparency in the FX trading market with the competitive and market-driven No Dealing Desk (NDD) execution  providing our partners the confidence to trade.

With NDD, FXCM acts as a price aggregator. We take the best available bid and best ask prices from our liquidity providersglobal banks, financial institutions and other market makers and stream those prices to the end platform. This large, diverse group of liquidity providers makes this model special: The more advantageous the prices, the more order flow the provider receives. Through competition, NDD ensures prices are market-driven and fair.

Advantages:
	Low spreads 
	No indicative quotes, they are all executable
	Anonymous order execution
	No re-quotes; no dealer intervention
	No restrictions on trading strategies (traders can scalp, trade the news, use any Automated Strategies)


FXCM No Dealing Desk Execution Model:

FXCM aggregates bid and ask prices from a pool of liquidity providers and is the final counterparty when trading with the No Dealing Desk (NDD) execution model. With NDD, FXCM's platforms display the best-available direct bid and ask prices from the liquidity providers. In some circumstances, FXCM may add a markup to NDD spreads, based on account type. In addition to the spread, the trading cost with NDD is a fixed lot-based commission at the open and close of the trade. 

There are many other factors to consider when choosing an execution model (such as conflict of interest, trading style or strategy). We believe the NDD model to be the optimal execution model for those looking for a broker solution meeting their technology requirements.
